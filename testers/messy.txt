  A Note from Jaime

It is my humble honor to represent Southwest Washington in the other
Washington. As U.S. Representative for  Washingtons 3rd Congressional
District  , it is my job to take your voice to Congress and solve problems on
your behalf.  This is the best region in the country, in terms of its great
people and the natural beauty found here.

And I want my kids and grandkids to have the same opportunities we did 
right here.  Thats why Im fighting for solutions and standing up for
the values that make this region great.

By empowering job-creating small businesses, protecting citizens from sending
more of their hard-earned money to the government than they need to, and
preserving wonderful resources like Mt. St. Helens and our wild salmon runs,
well be successful.

Together, can keep Southwest Washington special for generations to come. Will
you join me?

-Jaime
